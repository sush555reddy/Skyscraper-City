# Skyscraper-City
Skyscraper City [20]Objective: Give you some practice with tags, interfacing scripts with the Inspector, and problem solving, as you enter ... Skyscraper City!Overview: Skyscraper City consists of a series of skyscrapers. Each is made of stacks of offices — each in the shape of a square. The object of this assignment is to make Skyscraper City. The user will specify the height of each skyscraper and its location (in the inspector). When the game starts Skyscraper City will be generated.Note that there are two parts to this assignment -- the Slightly Easier Version and the Fearless Version: both must be turned in.Getting Started: [6]1.Make 6 Sprite Prefabs, dieRed1, dieRed2, dieRed3, dieRed4, dieRed5 and dieRed6, using the dice .png files found in Kenney Game Assets (in the Boardgame pack). 2.Store these prefabs in a folder in Assets called Resources. [1]3.Create the Ground — an empty GameObject populated with a series of tiles (different from the ones you chose in step 1) so that it looks like the ground. It should extend the entire length of the world. Use copy, paste, V snapping, and the power of exponentiation to make this quickly. [2]4.Make the Ground and dieRed1-dieRed6 prefabs BoxCollider2Ds.5.Create a Player sprite (make it a prefab).6.Create a script for the player so that it can move horizontally and vertically under player control using the WASD keys. Use the transform approach described in class. [2]7.Make the Player a BoxCollider2D and RigidBody2D. Set its Gravity Scale to 0.02. 8.Make an empty GameObject, Mayor. Attach a script to it, SkyscraperMaker. [1]SkyscraperMaker: The Slightly Easier Version (?) [7]1.The SkyscraperMaker class will have •two public variables: skyscraperHeights (string) and ground (GameObject) [1]•one method, generateSkyscrapers(), called in Start()  [1]2.skyscraperHeights will store a word, and each letter of that word — specifically, it's ordinal position in the alphabet — represents the height of one Skyscraper. For example, if the word was CABS, then the skyscraper heights would be 3, 1, 2, 19. If the word was CAFFE, the skyscraper heights would be 3, 1, 6, 6, 5.3.generateSkyscrapers() will instantiate the dice to form skyscrapers.They will be placed so that their bases just touch the ground, at positions x=0, 1, 2, 3, ... [5]generateSkyscrapers() Hints:1.Create a GameObject [] called dice, and wrap a for loop around this statement to fill it::     dice[i] = (GameObject)Resources.Load("dieRed" + (i+1));2.Now you have an array, call Instantiate(dice[j], new Vector3(x, y, 0.0f), Quaternion.identity) to instantiate die faces.•Figuring out the values for j, x and y may take a little contemplation. ���•When/if you get stuck, ask your TA or instructor for guidance. 3.The dice prefabs might need a little scaling so that there is no gap between them; and the initial value of  y, to place the dice directly on the ground with no gap, might also need some finagling.
SkyscraperMaker: The Fearless Version [5]Instead of generating skyscrapers at x= 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., we will specify the locations in another variable.1.Add a 3rd public variable, skyscraperLocations (string) to SkyscraperMaker. 1.Its contents will consist of a series of comma-delimited integers (e.g., -4, -3, -1, 0) that will dictate the x coordinates of the skyscrapers2.Modify generateSkyscrapers() so that it places the skyscrapers at the indicated positions. [5]1.e.g., if skyscraperLocations is "-6, -3, -2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7" and skyscraperHeights is "GABEFEST", it would generate skyscrapers of size 7 (at x=-6), 1 (at x=-3), 2 (x=-2), 5 (x=2), etc
